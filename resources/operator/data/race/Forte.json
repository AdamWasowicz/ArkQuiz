    "Race": "Forte",
    "Description": "Fortes have the traits of bovines and camelids, both of which are artiodactyls. For the former, their bovine traits can be seen from the shape of their horns. For the latter, their camelid traits can be seen from the shape of their ears and the ability to survive in hot arid deserts."
