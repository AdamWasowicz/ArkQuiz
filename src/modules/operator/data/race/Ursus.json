    "Race": "Ursus",
    "Description": "Ursi have the traits of bears, which includes giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Their ursine traits can be seen from the shape of their ears and somewhat bulkier stature than other Terran humans. Ursi do have tails, which is largely unnoticeable due to the short length."
